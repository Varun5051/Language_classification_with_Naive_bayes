Hello..
My name is Varun Kaushik. In this project I have created a language classification using Naive Bayes. So this, language classifier differentiate between:
1.) Slovak
2.) Czech
3.) English languages. 

You can also add the languages but for that you need to have dataset for that language, you can check working of this project by writing any sentence in any of the above language in the cell which is before Task-1.

Thank you.
